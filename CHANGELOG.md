# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Generic Daski provider starter based on the production provider architecture.
- Dummy reference service with free and paid paths, asset provisioning, docs,
  and co-located tests.
- Testnet-first onboarding, local integration, service-authoring, and AI-agent
  guidance.
- Genericity and composition gates that prevent known provider-specific
  services, suppliers, brands, and policies from entering the starter.
- Human-first onboarding guides for existing API and MCP products, including
  Testnet evidence, Mainnet allowlisting, configuration, and troubleshooting.
- A loopback-only PostgreSQL 16 Compose service and a read-only, redacted
  `doctor` for local, Testnet, and Mainnet readiness diagnostics.
- Harness-neutral coding-agent guidance that links to the canonical Daski
  Provider integration skill without duplicating it in this repository.
- Documentation and release-package validation gates, including enforcement of
  the canonical skill's single-copy boundary.

### Changed

- Made doctor tooling portable across LF and CRLF checkouts and added a focused
  Windows tooling CI gate.
- Clarified Provider versus upstream Supplier terminology and linked the
  official Base Sepolia faucet directory from Testnet wallet setup.
- Made optional LLM configuration truly optional and added concise,
  value-redacted startup configuration errors.
- Made dummy input limits Unicode-aware and its provisioned asset identifiers
  task-bound so repeated titles cannot collide.
- Added a safe, dummy-only offline skill walkthrough and documented every
  operator/CI script by risk.
- Collapsed the unpublished inherited migration history into a clean starter
  baseline for new provider databases.
- Made the Dockerfile the canonical deployment artifact and removed the
  upstream hosting-vendor descriptor.
- Renamed the private package metadata to match the public provider
  repository.
- Clarified standard-rail release accounting as an interval-based invariant.

### Removed

- All source, configuration, migrations, documentation, and tests belonging to
  the original provider's marketplace offerings and suppliers.
